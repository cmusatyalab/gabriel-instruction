The Android client is available on
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.cmu.cs.gabrielclient).

You can find containers for running each of these cognitive enginges on our
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cmusatyalab) page.

[This playlist](http://goo.gl/02m0nL) contains video demos of some of these
applications.

## HoloLens

The source code is in the [hololens](hololens) directory. The
[README file](hololens/README.md) in that directory describes how to build the

The HoloLens client only supports the sandwich cognitive engine.
